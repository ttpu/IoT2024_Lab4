## Lab Guide:

### Task 1: Connecting ESP32 to Wi-Fi and Reading Temperature Data from the LM35 Sensor
In this task, you will set up your ESP32 to connect to a Wi-Fi network and read temperature data from an LM35 sensor, and print it to the Serial monitor. This task helps you understand the basics of using ESP32 as a Wi-Fi-enabled IoT device and how to collect temperature data for later use.
Your program must read and send temperature data every 5 second to the Serial port

For the rest of instruction, follow the *pdf guide of Lab 3* and the **task1.ino** file comments and TODO list


### Task 2: Sending and Receiving Temperature Data with Dweet.io
In this task, you'll extend your ESP32 functionality to send temperature data to dweet.io and retrieve temperature data from another team's device. You will use two essential libraries: “HTTPClient” for HTTP communication and “ArduinoJSON” to format and parse JSON data.

Objective
*	Send temperature data from the LM35 sensor to dweet.io every 3 seconds.
*	Retrieve data from the other team’s ESP32 every 3 seconds.
*	Display the retrieved temperature data on the Serial Monitor.
