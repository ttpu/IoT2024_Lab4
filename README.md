## Lab Guide:

### Task 1: Connecting ESP32 to Wi-Fi and Reading Temperature Data from the LM35 Sensor
In this task, you will set up your ESP32 to connect to a Wi-Fi network and read temperature data from an LM35 sensor, and print it to the Serial monitor. This task helps you understand the basics of using ESP32 as a Wi-Fi-enabled IoT device and how to collect temperature data for later use.
Your program must read and send temperature data every 5 second to the Serial port
